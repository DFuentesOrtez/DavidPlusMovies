                            <p>Now, I've never really been a fan of musicals, since like forever. BUT La La Land was so
                                magical, cute, and heartbreaking.</p>

                            <p>The music was great, choreography great. But that chemistry? irreplicable. Emma Stone (my

                                together in any movie.

                                through different personalities, and it kind of annoys me in a way. It makes me think
                                about my past actions in relationships, how I approached things and would definitely
                                want to do things differently. But coming to accept the past is important to a healthy

                            <p>Absolutely loved this.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>I really love the relatability of this movie. I feel like anyone can see themselves in
                                Will, some just need the guidance.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The dialogue between Will and Sean is so good. Them slowly peeling back layers over time,
                                they may say things the other doesn't like but it can be truthful. Eventually they
                                develop such a great relationship.</p>

                            <p>So damn heartbreaking though, I can't imagine how any person would handle any of this.
                                how can you not imagine how things would have gone if things did/didn't happen, if
                                things worked in another lifetime. So many what ifs but life does things for a purpose.

                            <p>I'm glad that there was a chance for closure, not everyone gets to reflect on the past
                                like that.</p>

                            <p>My concept of relationships has been heavily influenced by this movie. Every single
                                interaction holds some kind of meaning, it has a purpose. It makes me think about if
                                that stranger I nodded to and I had some meaningful relationship in another life.</p>
